# Projectile Motion Calculator

This project is a simple physics-based program that calculates the key parameters of projectile motion using classical mechanics formulas. It was built to strengthen my understanding of Python and basic physics.

## Features
- Calculates:
  - Time of flight
  - Maximum height
  - Horizontal range
  - Horizontal and vertical positions at a given time
- A trajectory table showing (x, y) motion values over time
- Clean, beginner-friendly Python code

## How It Works
The program uses standard projectile motion equations:
- Converts launch angle from degrees to radians
- Uses ( g = 9.8 m/s^2) as gravitational acceleration

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download the file `projectile_motion_calculator.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
4. Enter:
- Initial velocity (m/s)
- Launch angle (degrees)

## Example Output
You will see:
- Time of flight
- Maximum height
- Range
- Position at a chosen time
- A full trajectory table

## Why I Built This
I created this project as a practice exercise to improve at:
- Writing clean Python code
- Applying physics formulas to real problems
- Building small but useful scientific programs
- I’m still improving my data-visualization skills, so for now I used a simple trajectory table instead of Matplotlib or Plotly charts. I’ll update this project later with a plotted trajectory once I learn more.
