Python projectile motion calculator: time of flight, maximum height, range, and a trajectory table.
# Projectile Motion Calculator

A Python program that calculates key projectile motion values using physics formulas:
- Time of flight
- Maximum height
- Range
- Position at a chosen time
- Optional trajectory table (x and y positions)

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.
2. Run in your terminal or command prompt:

   python projectile_motion_calculator.py

3. Enter the initial velocity (m/s) and launch angle (degrees) when prompted.

## Notes
- Gravity constant: g = 9.8 m/s²
- This project was created to practice Python and classical mechanics.
